# BootBoost

Every time the game starts it has to decrypt the .bhd files in the game directory, which takes a surprisingly long time. Fortunately if you decrypt them yourself and replace the files it will just load them directly, which is what this tool does.  
I recommend using with the [NoLogo Mod](https://github.com/bladecoding/DarkSouls3RemoveIntroScreens/releases/tag/v1.15b) for maximum speed.  
Requires [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-6.0.202-windows-x64-installer) - Windows 10 users should already have this.
