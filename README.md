# BootBoost

Every time the game starts it has to decrypt the .bhd files in the game directory, which takes a surprisingly long time. Fortunately if you decrypt them yourself and replace the files it will just load them directly, which is what this tool does.  
I recommend using with the [NoLogo Mod](https://github.com/bladecoding/DarkSouls3RemoveIntroScreens/releases/tag/v1.15b) for maximum speed.  
Requires [.NET 4.7.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net472) - Windows 10 users should already have this.

2. Run it.

# Uninstallation
1. Restore the original files from the "BootBoost Backup" folder.
